### Project Title
Data Analysis of California Wildfires from 1992 - 2020

#### Executive summary

#### Rationale
Preliminary review of the data and established reasoning suggest that both the incidence and severity of wildfires in California have risen over the last ten years. An in-depth understanding of these trends is critical from several standpoints:

1.	Environmental impacts encompass ecosystem disruption, loss of biodiversity, and exacerbation of climate feedback mechanisms. These matters require careful consideration by land management agencies when developing mitigation strategies.

2.	The human and economic consequences are significant for insurers and other stakeholders with financial interests in the region. Notably, losses from the 2018 California wildfires alone exceeded $148 billion. Therefore, enhanced insight into the temporal and spatial patterns of wildfire events can empower agencies, businesses, and individuals to make more informed land use and risk mitigation decisions.


#### Research Question
How have shifts in global temperature trends influenced the frequency and severity of wildfires in California from 1992 - 2020?

#### Methodology
Following data cleaning—which includes handling missing values and outliers—I will perform feature engineering as appropriate. Subsequent exploratory data analysis will employ methods such as geospatial analysis and descriptive statistics. To identify patterns and gain insights, I plan to implement regression, classification, and advanced geospatial analytical techniques.

#### Results
Preliminary results based on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and inital modeling indicate that California's wildfires, while no more frequent during the study period, are significantly more severe in the amount of acreage burned per year. Additionally, we were able to determine basic characteristics of California Wildfires such as the counties that experience the most wildfire and most acreage burned, the most prevalent and damaging months for wildfire starts as well as the leading causes of wildfire in the state over the course of the study period.

#### Next steps
1- Attempt to tune our Regression and Random Forest Classifier models
2- Atttempt to correlate the increasing severity of wildfire in Californa to local weather trends such as average temperature and average precipitation as well as any shifts in the timing of these events during the study period. I'd like to understand how these weather patterns are affecting the timing and duration of California's wildfire season.
